# Stacker

Available to play at itch.io: https://impojr.itch.io/endless-stacker

Just like the frustrating arcade game, but forever!

How to Play

Use the spacebar to place a row of blocks. Align the rows on top of each other and build your tower. It gets faster, but resets endlessly at the top!

Source Code

You can find the source code on this repository.
The paid assets are not committed, so you won't be able to play it locally, but it should still work as an example for the code.
